Seeking to evolve and improve my skills, I used a project previously carried out by me together with my group in the Proz front-end development course, the fruit ecommerce: <a href="https://github.com/pazedev/OnlyFrutas">Onlyfrutas.

- <b>Start:</b> April/2025
- <b>Improvements:</b> design clean and mobile-first development
- <b>Project paused in May/2025 for study reasons</b>.
  As I found it difficult to develop the project alone, I started more studies to improve my performance on this project.
- <b>Expected completion:</b> December/2025
